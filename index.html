        <h1>Hello! I&rsquo;m Sarah.</h1>
        <p class="intro">I&rsquo;m a <strong>graphic designer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> web developer.</strong>
        <br>I like riding my motorcycle, travelling the world, and learning new things. In my spare time, I make things that are <strong>beautiful to look at <span class="amp">&amp;</span> easy to use.</strong></p>

      <div class="large-8 medium-8 columns">
		<p>For the last eight years, I&rsquo;ve been running a full-time freelance design business. I love my work and I love my clients, but I&rsquo;ve realized <strong>it&rsquo;s time for a change</strong>. Building and growing a business has been an incredible experience. It&rsquo;s taught me to communicate better, to back up my design decisions with reasoned arguments, and to manage my time effectively. 
		<p>It&rsquo;s also taught me that running a business is not where I excel. I want to spend more time doing work I love (design!) and less time doing work I don&rsquo;t (accounting, responding to RFPs, using words like &ldquo;synergistic.&rdquo;)
		<p><strong>I am looking for a chance to do better work.</strong></p>
		
		<p>As a designer-developer and a self-styled &ldquo;jill of all trades,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to learn all kinds of skills. If your copy doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right, I can help you tweak it. Need someone to manage a project, keep everything on track, and oversee everyone? I&rsquo;m your girl. I&rsquo;m also very strong technically. Developers love me because I use git with gusto and I&rsquo;m not afraid to get my hands messy with code.</p>
		
		<p>Over the last three years, I&rsquo;ve visited over thirty-four different countries in four different continents. I&rsquo;ve spent a total of sixteen months in Canada, all while running a successful, thriving business. Working while on the move hasn&rsquo;t always been easy, but it&rsquo;s taught me to balance my workload and communicate effectively. As a result, I&rsquo;m efficient, coordinated, and I&rsquo;m an absolute <em>champion</em> remote worker.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s my exploratory nature that makes me a great designer. I am always looking, always learning, always seeking new things. As a result, my work is varied, considered, and ever-improving.</p>
		<p><strong>In short: I am great. Hire me!</strong></p>

		 </div>
	     
	     <div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I'm detail-oriented</h3>
          	<p>I've yet to meet a pixel I didn't think need nudging down a squidge, or a line of code I thought couldn't be shorter, or a colour I thought didn't need to be tweaked. But I never let perfect be the enemy of great. Instead, I'll progressively enhance a design until it's better and better.</p>
		 </div>
		 
		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I'm hooked on learning</h3>
          	<p>I've taught myself pretty much everything I know, and I'm constantly picking up new tools. In the past year, I've taught myself Sass, git, responsive design tactics, a few WordPress/CSS frameworks, and a slew of new jQuery tricks, and have made many of them part of my workflow. I approach new projects by first evaluating which tools are best suited to the project, then diving in, and I refuse to use an ill-suited tool out of mere convenience.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I wear a lot of hats</h3>
          	<p>Running a business means you've got to have a <em>lot</em> of complimentary skills. I've done copywriting, project management, technical writing, documentation, accounting, marketing, on top of my usual designer-developer things. I've been responsible for the selection and hiring of freelance illustration, development, and writing talents and have coordinated projects with many different team members distributed around the globe.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I solve problems</h3>
          	<p>I don't believe in hurdles. I developed my own system for syncing WordPress sites from a local development to a production server, using shell scripts and database dumps, and stored in git, and spoke about it at Montreal's WordCamp. Any time something comes up that throws me for a loop, I try to figure out a way to work around it, so that I can be more efficient and effective.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I'm quick like a bunny</h3>
          	<p>Time management is one of those things you either pick up or die trying running a business. I'm used to juggling six different projects at a time, each with different deadlines, requirements, and clients in different timezones. On top of that, I've often been in the jungles of South America or wandering the deltas of Southeast Asia while I've been doing all that. In short: I get stuff <em>done</em>.</p>

     			<h2>Parallax-scrolling<br>responsive WordPress site</h2>
     			<p>When E.L. Tettensor asked me to build her a website to promote her debut novel, she said she wanted an immersive experience—like stepping inside the pages of the book. It needed to be old-fashioned, dark, and ornate. She mentioned that she liked parallax scrolling effects, but that they might be a bit out of reach. Naturally, I took this as a challenge. This site was my first experience with parallax effects—and I went a step further, making the site was responsive as well. The result is a site that’s as immersive on a phone as on a computer.</p>

     			<blockquote>I had a few good proposals for my website, but Sarah was absolutely the right choice. Not only did she completely understand what I was going for, she was able to execute to perfection, pairing an artist’s eye with an engineer&rsquo;s attention to detail. After helping me find just the right artist to do the background illustration, she meticulously sourced the fonts and images, culminating in an organic, immersive experience that perfectly captures the mood of the books. Small wonder the website has received so many compliments! I fully expect to work with Sarah again in the future.</blockquote>

     			<h2>Custom WordPress site for a spa</h2>
     			<p>Cascades Day Spa is one of Halifax&rsquo;s longest-running and most well-known day spas. They have a loyal clientele and an excellent reputation, but their old website just wasn&rsquo;t pulling its weight anymore. Built on a Contribute platform, it was difficult to update, hard to navigate, and its design was sorely outdated. The site needed an overhaul to be in line with their business and to allow for continued growth and new customers.</p>
		
	<p>They requested that the site be simple, clean, and easy to navigate. At the same time, they knew they needed something that would be accessible on phones and tablets. Of primary importance were the gift certificates and the book online functionality, both of which needed to be as easy to use as possible from both a client and a company perspective.</p>
					
	<p>After evaluating their precise needs from an administrative point of view, I suggested a few options for online gift certificates, set up an online appointment booking form, and set up a custom WordPress installation. Promotions are managed as a special post type, allowing for easy entry without replicating content in multiple places.</p>

     			<h2>Grungy WordPress site for horror blog</h2>
     			<p>Lauren was looking for a fun, whimsical design for her new blog. Most of my work tends to be on the more serious side, but Lauren's horror movie blog is clever and fun, so we had an opportunity to be a little more creative with its design.

I spent a long time poring over old pulp horror movie posters and picking images out of public-domain pulp sci-fi comics to come up with this design. I used more typefaces than I would ordinarily in order to give it more of a retro-pulp feel, and added little illustrations to liven up the sidebar. Lauren provided the lovely header illustration, and all other elements were carefully designed to pull all the pieces together. </p>

She took a very loose concept (a horror blog with a retro, pulp look) and gave me something that fit my brand, and personality, perfectly. This was my first time working with a designer and I couldn&rsquo;t have been happier with my experience. Sarah walked me through every step, listened to my feedback, and provided quick results. </blockquote>
