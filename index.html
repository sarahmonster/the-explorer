        <h1><span>Hello!</span> I&rsquo;m Sarah.</h1>
        <p class="intro">I&rsquo;m a <strong>graphic designer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> web developer.</strong>
        <br>I like riding my motorcycle, travelling the world, and learning new things. In my spare time, I make things that are <strong>beautiful to look at <span class="amp">&amp;</span> easy to use.</strong></p>        
      </div>
      
    </div><!-- end .row -->

	<div class="row">
      <div class="large-8 medium-8 column">
		<p>For the last eight years, I&rsquo;ve been running a full-time freelance design business. I love my work and I love my clients, but I&rsquo;ve realized <strong>it&rsquo;s time for a change</strong>. Building and growing my business has been an incredible experience. It&rsquo;s taught me to communicate better, to back up my design decisions with reasoned arguments, and to manage my time effectively. 
		<p>It&rsquo;s also taught me that running a business is not where my passion lies. I want to spend more time doing work I love (design!) and less time doing work I don&rsquo;t (accounting, responding to RFPs, using words like &ldquo;synergistic.&rdquo;)
		<p><strong>I am looking to do better work.</strong></p>
		
		<p>As a designer-developer and a self-styled &ldquo;jill of all trades,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to learn all kinds of skills. If your copy doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right, I can help you tweak it. Need someone to manage a project, keep everything on track, and oversee everyone? I&rsquo;m your girl. I&rsquo;m also very strong technically. Developers love me because I use git with gusto and I&rsquo;m not afraid to get my hands messy with code.</p>
		
		<p>Over the last three years, I&rsquo;ve visited over thirty-four different countries in four different continents. I&rsquo;ve spent a total of sixteen months in Canada, all while running a successful, thriving business. Working while on the move hasn&rsquo;t always been easy, but it&rsquo;s taught me to balance my workload and communicate effectively. As a result, I&rsquo;m efficient, coordinated, and I&rsquo;m an absolute <em>champion</em> remote worker.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s my exploratory nature that makes me a great designer. I am always looking, always learning, always seeking new things. As a result, my work is varied, considered, and ever-improving.</p>
		<p><strong>In short: I am great. Hire me!</strong></p>

	     		<p>Wicker Emporium is a Canadian furniture retailer with twenty-six locations across Ontario and the Maritimes. I started working with them five years ago, and have since grown the role such that I&rsquo;m responsible for a wide array of tasks.

     			<h3>Newsletter</h3>
     			<p>Using a series of custom-developed MailChimp templates&mdash;built responsively, of course&mdash;I design, code, and send various different types of newsletters to a growing list of subscribers&mdash;currently over 31,000.</p>
     			<h3>Quality Control</h3>
     			<p>In an effort to improve the customer experience, I spearheaded a style guide for website copy and product naming guidelines. I also established a social media policy and hired a social media manager, an effort which saw a marked improvement in user engagement. We then launched a WordPress blog, fully integrated with the Magento site.</p>
     			<h3>E-Commerce Website</h3>
     			<p>Wicker Emporium&rsquo;s old website used a table-based layout and an extremely buggy ExpressionEngine-based CMS. After several years of fighting with an uncooperative site, they were ready to rebuild using Magento. I redesigned their entire site, greatly improving on its design and maintainability, with a focus on responsive design (many of the site&rsquo;s users browse on their iPads).</p>
     			<p>I implemented git for version control, set up development and production environments, and enforced best development practises for a team of developers from different companies. I sourced and implemented various plugins to improve performance and functionality, and I hired and oversaw copywriting and illustration talent for site pages. (I learned a lot about Magento too!)</p>
     			<h3>Branding &amp; Promotions</h3>
     			<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve helped grow the Wicker Emporium brand as they introduced it to new markets (primarily with the introduction of stores in Ontario). I spearheaded shifting the brand focus&mdash;gradually&mdash;to a more modern look-and-feel, without alienating existing customers. This has meant the gradual introduction of new fonts, patterns, and stylistic elements into an overall style library that is used for advertisements, posters, print and web ads, signage, tags, gift cards, invitations, and all manner of materials.</p>
