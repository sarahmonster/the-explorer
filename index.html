        <h1><span>Hello!</span> I&rsquo;m Sarah.</h1>
        <p class="intro">I&rsquo;m a <strong>graphic designer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> web developer.</strong>
        <br>I like riding my motorcycle, travelling the world, and learning new things. In my spare time, I make things that are <strong>beautiful to look at <span class="amp">&amp;</span> easy to use.</strong></p>        
      </div>

      <div class="large-8 medium-8 column">
		<p>For the last eight years, I&rsquo;ve been running a full-time freelance design business. I love my work and I love my clients, but I&rsquo;ve realized <strong>it&rsquo;s time for a change</strong>. Building and growing my business has been an incredible experience. It&rsquo;s taught me to communicate better, to back up my design decisions with reasoned arguments, and to manage my time effectively. 
		<p>It&rsquo;s also taught me that running a business is not where my passion lies. I want to spend more time doing work I love (design!) and less time doing work I don&rsquo;t (accounting, responding to RFPs, using words like &ldquo;synergistic.&rdquo;)
		<p><strong>I&rsquo;m looking to do better work.</strong></p>
		
		<p>As a designer-developer and a self-styled &ldquo;jill of all trades,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to learn all kinds of skills. If your copy doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right, I can help you tweak it. Need someone to manage a project, keep everything on track, and oversee everyone? I&rsquo;m your girl. I&rsquo;m also super-technical. Developers love me because I use git with gusto and I&rsquo;m not afraid to get my hands messy with code.</p>
		
		<p>Over the last three years, I&rsquo;ve visited over thirty-four different countries in five different continents. I&rsquo;ve spent a total of sixteen months in Canada, all while running a successful, thriving business. Working while on the move hasn&rsquo;t always been easy, but it&rsquo;s taught me to balance my workload and communicate effectively. As a result, I&rsquo;m efficient, coordinated, and I&rsquo;m an absolute <em>champion</em> remote worker.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s my exploratory nature that makes me a great designer. I am always looking, always learning, always seeking new things. As a result, my work is varied, considered, and ever-improving.</p>
		<p><strong>In short: I am great. Hire me!</strong></p>

     			<p>While upgrading to Magento and WordPress, I redesigned their site, greatly improving its maintainability. Responsive design was important, as many of the site&rsquo;s users browse on their iPads.</p>
     			<h3>Quality Control</h3>
     			<p>I developed a style guide for website copy and product naming guidelines. I also established a social media policy and hired a social media manager, an effort which saw a marked improvement in user engagement. I continue to oversee copywriting and illustrative work.</p>
     			<h3>Developer Workflow</h3>
     			<p>I implemented git for version control, set up development and production environments, and enforced best practises for a team of developers from different companies. I also helped set up the server that runs their production website, optimizing it for security and speed.</p>
     			<h3>Newsletters</h3>
     			<p>Using a series of custom-developed, responsive MailChimp templates, I send a variety of weekly newsletters to a growing list of subscribers&mdash;currently over 31,000.</p>
     			<h3>Branding &amp; Promotions</h3>
     			<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve helped grow the Wicker Emporium brand as they introduced it to new markets. I spearheaded shifting the brand focus&mdash;gradually&mdash;to a more modern look-and-feel.</p>
     			<p>This has meant the introduction of new fonts, patterns, and stylistic elements into an overall style library that is used for advertisements, posters, print and web ads, signage, tags, gift cards, invitations, and all manner of materials.</p>

     			<h2>Parallax-scrolling <br>responsive WordPress site</h2>
     			<p>E.L. Tettensor approached me with a challenge: she wanted an old-fashioned, dark, and ornate WordPress site to promote her new book, and she liked parallax scrolling effects. Even though it was my first time, I was confident I could do it&mdash;and make it responsive to boot.</p>

     			<h3>Art direction</h3>
     			<p>After some searching, we decided on an illustrator we both liked and could work with. Once the illustration was nearly ready, I was able to start creating elements that would match&mdash;a logotype of sorts, a handful of icons, smoke textures, and various textures and backgrounds.</p>
     			<h3>WordPress theme</h3>
     			<p>I built a template that pulled each content page into a one-page design for the front page. I used <a href="http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/">Stellar.js</a> to implement parallax effects on each panel, then overlaid effects for decoration&rsquo;s sake. Each panel has a unique design, while remaining in line with the overall theme.</p>
     			<h3>Making it responsive</h3>
     			<p>Given performance and size constraints, I decided against the parallax effects on mobile devices. As a result, I simplified the design for smaller screens, removing the transitions between panels and allowing each panel to scroll. I tested extensively to ensure the site works as well as possible on all sorts of devices.</p>
     			<h3>CSS Animations</h3>
     			<p>As a final touch, I added introductory animations to the first panel. CSS animations are carefully timed so that the effect of a light turning on in the room is given, and then each element slowly fades in, with the smoke the final element.</p>
     			<p>The final result was an immersive, elegant, and usable site that my client was delighted with.</p>
