        <h1><span>Hello!</span> I&rsquo;m Sarah.</h1>
        <p class="intro">I&rsquo;m a <strong>graphic designer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> web developer.</strong>
        <br>I like riding my motorcycle, travelling the world, and learning new things. In my spare time, I make things that are <strong>beautiful to look at <span class="amp">&amp;</span> easy to use.</strong></p>

		<p>For the last eight years, I&rsquo;ve been running a full-time freelance design business. I love my work and I love my clients, but I&rsquo;ve realized <strong>it&rsquo;s time for a change</strong>. Building and growing my business has been an incredible experience. It&rsquo;s taught me to communicate better, to back up my design decisions with reasoned arguments, and to manage my time effectively. 
		<p>It&rsquo;s also taught me that running a business is not where my passion lies. I want to spend more time doing work I love (design!) and less time doing work I don&rsquo;t (accounting, responding to RFPs, using words like &ldquo;synergistic.&rdquo;)
		<p><strong>I am looking to do better work.</strong></p>
		
		<p>As a designer-developer and a self-styled &ldquo;jill of all trades,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to learn all kinds of skills. If your copy doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right, I can help you tweak it. Need someone to manage a project, keep everything on track, and oversee everyone? I&rsquo;m your girl. I&rsquo;m also very strong technically. Developers love me because I use git with gusto and I&rsquo;m not afraid to get my hands messy with code.</p>
		
		<p>Over the last three years, I&rsquo;ve visited over thirty-four different countries in four different continents. I&rsquo;ve spent a total of sixteen months in Canada, all while running a successful, thriving business. Working while on the move hasn&rsquo;t always been easy, but it&rsquo;s taught me to balance my workload and communicate effectively. As a result, I&rsquo;m efficient, coordinated, and I&rsquo;m an absolute <em>champion</em> remote worker.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s my exploratory nature that makes me a great designer. I am always looking, always learning, always seeking new things. As a result, my work is varied, considered, and ever-improving.</p>
		<p><strong>In short: I am great. Hire me!</strong></p>

     			<div class="services">Art Direction, Design &amp; Development, Newsletters<br>Copyediting, Magento, WordPress, Print</div>
     			<h2>Ongoing web &amp; print work<br>for a furniture retail chain</h2>
     			<p>Wicker Emporium is a Canadian furniture retailer with twenty-six locations across Ontario and the Maritimes. I started working with them five years ago, and have since grown the role such that I&rsquo;m responsible for a wide array of tasks. I do all of their online and physical design work, from in-store banners to email newsletters.</p>
     			<h3>Newsletter</h3>
     			<p>Using a series of custom-developed MailChimp templates&mdash;built responsively, of course&mdash;I design, code, and send various different types of newsletters to a growing list of subscribers&mdash;currently over 31,000.</p>
     			<h3>Quality Control</h3>
     			<p>In an effort to improve the customer experience, I spearheaded a style guide for website copy and product naming guidelines. I also established a social media policy and hired a social media manager, an effort which saw a marked improvement in user engagement. We then launched a WordPress blog, fully integrated with the Magento site.</p>
     			<h3>E-Commerce Website</h3>
     			<p>Wicker Emporium&rsquo;s old website used a table-based layout and an extremely buggy ExpressionEngine-based CMS. After several years of fighting with an uncooperative site, they were ready to rebuild using Magento. I redesigned their entire site, greatly improving on its design and maintainability, with a focus on responsive design (many of the site&rsquo;s users browse on their iPads).</p>
     			<p>I implemented git for version control, set up development and production environments, and enforced best development practises for a team of developers from different companies. I sourced and implemented various plugins to improve performance and functionality, and I hired and oversaw copywriting and illustration talent for site pages. (I learned a lot about Magento too!)</p>
     			<h3>Branding &amp; Promotions</h3>
     			<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve helped grow the Wicker Emporium brand as they introduced it to new markets (primarily with the introduction of stores in Ontario). I spearheaded shifting the brand focus&mdash;gradually&mdash;to a more modern look-and-feel, without alienating existing customers. This has meant the gradual introduction of new fonts, patterns, and stylistic elements into an overall style library that is used for advertisements, posters, print and web ads, signage, tags, gift cards, invitations, and all manner of materials.</p>

     			<h2>Parallax-scrolling<br>responsive WordPress site</h2>
     			<p>E.L. Tettensor approached me with a challenge: she wanted an old-fashioned, dark, and ornate WordPress site to promote her new book, and she really liked parallax scrolling effects. Even though it was my first time, I was confident I could do it&mdash;and make it responsive to boot.</p> 
     			<h3>Art direction</h3>
     			<p>First, I helped E.L. find an illustrator. I did some preliminary searching, then presented her with five great options. I then worked with the chosen illustrator to create an image that would work well with the website I was planning. Once the illustration was nearly ready, I was able to start creating elements that would match&mdash;a logotype of sorts, a handful of icons, smoke textures, and various textures and backgrounds.</p>
     			<h3>WordPress theme</h3>
     			<p>The first hurdle was to build everything so it would pull information from WordPress. I built a template that pulled each content page into a single one-page display, then created an independent layout for the blog posts, post archives, and 404 page. I used <a href="http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/">Stellar.js</a> to implement parallax effects on each panel, and then interspersed each with intermediary panels and overlaid smoke for decoration's sake. Each panel is carefully arranged to have a unique design, while remaining part of a cohesive whole. </p>
     			<h3>Making it responsive</h3>
     			<p>After some experimentation, I decided that the parallax single-page scrolling effect was unnecessarily complex for a responsive implementation, mostly because the fixed-height panels became too restrictive. As a result, I simplified the design quite a great deal for smaller screens, removing the transitions between panels and allowing each panel to scroll. I carefully evaluated every panel from standardized breakpoints, testing extensively to ensure the site works as well as possible on all sorts of devices.</p>
     			<h3>CSS Animations</h3>
     			<p>As a final touch, I added introductory animations to the first panel. CSS animations are carefully timed so that the effect of a light turning on in the room is given, and then each element slowly fades in, with the smoke the final element.</p>
     			<p>The final result was an immersive, elegant, and utterly usable site that my client was delighted with.</p>

Not only did she completely understand what I was going for, she was able to execute to perfection, pairing an artist’s eye with an engineer&rsquo;s attention to detail. After helping me find just the right artist to do the background illustration, she meticulously sourced the fonts and images, culminating in an organic, immersive experience that perfectly captures the mood of the books. Small wonder the website has received so many compliments! I fully expect to work with Sarah again in the future.</blockquote>

     			<h2>Custom WordPress site for a spa</h2>
     			<p>Cascades Day Spa is one of Halifax&rsquo;s longest-running and most well-known day spas. I built them a new website that saw a dramatic increase in customer retention as well as bringing in new customers.</p>
	 			<h3>Website Revamp</h3>
	 			<p>The clients&rsquo; old website was a sorely out-of-date eyesore built on a Contribute platform. It made use of tables and font tags and was difficult to use from both a user and an administrative point of view. The site needed an overhaul to present a professional image and to allow for continued growth.</p>
	 			<h3>WordPress as CMS</h3>
	 			<p>I used WordPress to build the site, making use of special post types to allow for simple updates. I host the site on my WordPress-optimized VPS, making use of caching, security, and backup plugins to ensure bulletproof stability and lighting-fast performance.</p>
	 			
	 			<h3>Responsive design</h3>
	 			<p>The client wanted a site that was simple, clean, and easy to navigate. I used gentle colours and subtle ornamentation to give a serene feeling. I paid careful attention to ensure that the booking process was as simple as possible, and carefully coded everything to be responsive as well.</p>

     			<h3>Project Management</h3>
     			<p>Most of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on I&rsquo;ve helmed myself, and as such I&rsquo;ve been responsible for all aspects of the project; from sourcing stock imagery or custom illustration to ensuring that development runs smoothly and copy is well-crafted. I manage client expectations, control scope creep, plan timelines, and juggle multiple deadlines and projects&mdash;all with ease.</p>
     			<h3>Art Direction</h3>
     			<p>I&rsquo;ve also had the opportunity to work with other designers, developers, illustrators, animators, and copywriters, both of my choosing and my clients&rsquo;. My knowledge of lots of different fields means I always have something to contribute, and I&rsquo;m a tactful, considerate, and enthusiastic member of a team. I love working with smart people who are good at what they do.</p>
