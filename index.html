        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p class="intro">My name is Sarah. I'm a graphic designer and web developer located in Montreal. I craft beautiful things that are also easy to use.</p>        
		<p>I've spent the last eight years running a <a href="http://triggersandsparks.com">full-time freelance graphic design business</a>. I love my work and I love my clients, but I've realized that it's time for a change. Running my business for eight years has been an incredible experience. It's taught me to communicate better, to back up my design decisions with reasoned arguments, and to manage my time effectively. It's also taught me that running a business is not where I excel. I want to spend more time doing work I love (design!) and less time doing work I don't (accounting, cold-emailing, responding to RFPs.)
		<p>As a designer-developer and a self-styled "jill of all trades," I've had the opportunity to learn all kinds of skills. I'm a designer with a keen eye, but I'm also very strong technically. Developers love me because I use git, code my own stuff, and aren't afraid to get my hands messy with code. I'm happy suggesting changes to text in order to better fit the design or suit the marketing message. If I feel something doesn't make sense or doesn't work right, I'll let you know.</p>
		<p>I've also spent the last four years travelling while running my business. Working while on the move hasn't always been easy, but it's taught me to balance my workload and communicate effectively. As a result, I'm efficient, coordinated, and I'm a champion remote worker.</p>
		<p>In short: I am great. Hire me!</p>

	     	<h3>I'm a self-starter</h3>
          	<p>Did I mention that whole "running a business for eight years" thing? I am <em>super</em> motivated. </p>
		 </div>
	     
	     <div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I'm detail-oriented</h3>
          	<p>I've yet to meet a pixel I didn't think need nudging down a squidge, or a line of code I thought couldn't be shorter, or a colour I thought didn't need to be tweaked. But I never let perfect be the enemy of great. Instead, I'll progressively enhance a design until it's better and better.</p>
		 </div>
		 
		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I'm hooked on learning</h3>
          	<p>I've taught myself pretty much everything I know, and I'm constantly picking up new tools. In the past year, I've taught myself Sass, git, responsive design tactics, a few WordPress/CSS frameworks, and a slew of new jQuery tricks, and have made many of them part of my workflow. I approach new projects by first evaluating which tools are best suited to the project, then diving in, and I refuse to use an ill-suited tool out of mere convenience.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I wear a lot of hats</h3>
          	<p>Running a business means you've got to have a <em>lot</em> of complimentary skills. I've done copywriting, project management, technical writing, documentation, accounting, marketing, on top of my usual designer-developer things. I've been responsible for the selection and hiring of freelance illustration, development, and writing talents and have coordinated projects with many different team members distributed around the globe.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I solve problems</h3>
          	<p>I don't believe in hurdles. I developed my own system for syncing WordPress sites from a local development to a production server, using shell scripts and database dumps, and stored in git, and spoke about it at Montreal's WordCamp. Any time something comes up that throws me for a loop, I try to figure out a way to work around it, so that I can be more efficient and effective.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="large-4 medium-4 columns">
	     	<h3>I'm quick like a bunny</h3>
          	<p>Time management is one of those things you either pick up or die trying running a business. I'm used to juggling six different projects at a time, each with different deadlines, requirements, and clients in different timezones. On top of that, I've often been in the jungles of South America or wandering the deltas of Southeast Asia while I've been doing all that. In short: I get stuff <em>done</em>.</p>
