        <h2>My very own full-time<br>freelance design company</h2>
        <p>In eight years of running Triggers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sparks, I&rsquo;ve learned and I&rsquo;ve grown&mdash;not only as a designer, but also as a developer, a businesswoman, a marketer, and even <em>(sigh)</em> an accountant. In total, I&rsquo;ve worked with over ninety clients on hundreds of projects, including over 100 websites.</p>

      <h3>Projects tackled</h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve worked on WordPress blogs, built custom Rails apps, made MailChimp templates, integrated WordPress with Magento, done pixel art, designed logos &amp; icons, worked on video games for EA, built Facebook apps, made book covers, made newspaper &amp; magazine advertisements, designed iPhone apps, contributed to open source projects, designed window signage, and a whole bunch more. <em>Whew!</em></p>
      <h3>Project Management</h3>
      <p>Most of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on I&rsquo;ve helmed myself, and as such I&rsquo;ve been responsible for all aspects of the project; from sourcing stock imagery or custom illustration to ensuring that development runs smoothly and the copy is well-crafted (copywriting is part of design, after all). I manage client expectations, control scope creep, plan timelines, and juggle multiple deadlines and projects&mdash;all with ease.</p>
      <h3>Art Direction</h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve also had the opportunity to work with other designers, developers, illustrators, animators, and copywriters. My knowledge of lots of different fields means I always have something to contribute, and I&rsquo;m a tactful, considerate, and enthusiastic member of a team. I love working with smart people who are great at what they do.</p>
      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p>In my spare time I write a blog that focuses on design, travel, and running a successful business while travelling the world.</p>
