Hello!

I’m Sarah, and I’m a graphic designer, web developer, and world traveller who would love to work with you. I saw your job posting for a Senior UI/UX Designers on We Work Remotely and I think I'd be a great fit for the role.

I’ve been running my own freelance business for the last eight years, so I’m usually responsible for every stage of a website’s development: from wireframes and design mockups through to implementation and testing. This means I’m totally at home managing a project through its entire lifecycle. I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, Sass, and Compass, and I’m fairly handy with Javascript, Grunt, and jQuery (and interested in learning more!)

On top of that, I’ve got a good understanding of back-end development and I’m rather skilled at adapting designs for different devices.

I’d be super-excited to work on your apps—they’re beautifully designed already! dploy looks like a fantastic product, and I’ve actually found myself needing to deploy all kinds of varied apps and sites lately, so it’s a product I feel excited about.

You can find out more about me at sarahsemark.com. Please drop me a line--I’d love to chat further about us working together!

Cheers,
Sarah
