Hello!

I’m Sarah, and I’m a graphic designer, web developer, and world traveller who would love to work with you. I saw your job posting for a Senior UI/UX Designers on We Work Remotely and I think I'd be a great fit for the role.

I’ve been running my own freelance business for the last eight years, so I’m usually responsible for every stage of a website’s development: from wireframes and design mockups through to implementation and testing. This means I’m totally at home managing a project through its entire lifecycle. I have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, Sass, and Compass, and I’m fairly handy with Javascript, Grunt, and jQuery (and interested in learning more!)

On top of that, I’ve got a good understanding of back-end development and I’m rather skilled at adapting designs for different devices.

I’d be super-excited to work on your apps—they’re beautifully designed already! dploy looks like a fantastic product, and I’ve actually found myself needing to deploy all kinds of varied apps and sites lately, so it’s a product I feel excited about.

You can find out more about me at sarahsemark.com. Please drop me a line--I’d love to chat further about us working together!

Cheers,
Sarah

Hi Adam,  

I’m Sarah, and I’m a graphic designer, web developer, and world traveller who would love to work with you. I saw your job posting for a UI/UX Designer Mobile on We Work Remotely and I think I'd be a great fit for the role.

You can learn more about me and what I do at hire.sarahsemark.com

The most important thing to know is this: I absolutely adore design. I've been building websites on a freelance basis full-time for the last eight years, so I'm very accustomed to working with clients and delivering tailored solutions that meet their specific needs. I'm detail-oriented and I love making beautiful, usable things. I’m passionate, enthusiastic, and effective, and my clients love me as a result. I am, however, looking for a change, and I believe that what will make me happiest is spending less time on the business side of things, which I’m not so wild about, and more time on the design side, which I love.

On top of that, I’ve got a good understanding of back-end development (PHP, Rails, JS frameworks, mostly) and I’m rather skilled at adapting designs for different devices. I have extensive experience with websites, web apps, and email newsletters, so I’ll be able to work on your product in all its iterations.

I’d be super-excited to work on One Diary—it’s a great product, and I’d love to help me it better. Please drop me a line to talk further about working together. 

Thanks!

Hi Mokriyans!

I am, however, looking for a change, and I believe that what will make me happiest is spending less time on the business side of things, which I’m not so wild about, and more time on the design side, which I love. 

I’m a designer with a very strong technical background—most of the websites I've made I've also developed myself. As such, I have a good understanding of the limitations of the medium and I have a symbiotic relationship with developers. Grids and typography are important to me, so I tend to base most of my websites on a responsive grid these days. Though the bulk of my work has been with websites, I do have experience working on several different iOS and web apps, and I feel this would be a natural progression for me. I'd relish the opportunity to work on exciting new products that people use and love. 

I’d be super-excited to work on your apps—they’re beautifully designed already! I downloaded your Craigslist app last year when I was trying to source vintage furniture for my new apartment, and I was totally blown away by how gorgeous and usable it was. You took something that lacked in design and usability and make it an absolute pleasure to use. 

I’d love to talk further about working together. 

Thanks!

Sarah

Hello, Clearhaus!

I’m Sarah, and I’m a graphic designer, web developer, and world traveller. I’d love to work with you to make online payments more simple for merchants.

A bit more about me, from the technical side of things: I’m adept at HTML5/CSS3 (I use Sass) and have a solid understanding of Javascript. I’ve mostly used Foundation and Bourbon, but I do have experience with Bootstrap as well. I’ve built my own Rails apps, so I’ve got a good knowledge of Ruby. I’ve also worked with CoffeeScript and Jekyll a bit. I use git constantly (I actually gave a talk about using git and WordPress together last summer) and generally put all my projects on github. I’ve also worked with Heroku in the past. 

In short: I think I’d be a great fit for you, and this is just the challenge I’m looking for! I’d love to talk further about working together. 

Thanks!

I’ve built oodles of different WordPress sites (most of my sites these days are built on WordPress) so I’m very familiar with theming, plugins, filters, and using custom posts to extend the platform. InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop are almost always open on my machine (poor thing!) and I’m adept with PHP and HTML5/CSS3.

------ BANDZOOGLE -----

Hi Chris (and the rest of Bandzoogle)!

I’m Sarah, and I’m a graphic designer, web developer, and world traveller. I’d love to work with you to make better websites for bands! I’ve worked with bands and music festivals in the past, and I’ve always enjoyed it. As far as band sites I think are well-done, I’d have to cast my vote for Jurassic 5, Morcheeba, The Roots, and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.
