        <h2>Ongoing web <span class="amp">&amp;</span> print work<br>for a furniture retail chain</h2>
        <p>Wicker Emporium is a Canadian furniture retailer with twenty-six locations across Ontario and the Maritimes. I started working with them five years ago, and have since grown the role such that I&rsquo;m responsible for a wide array of tasks. I take care of all of their design work, from packaging to email newsletters.</p>

      <h3>E-Commerce Website</h3>
      <p>While upgrading to Magento and WordPress, I redesigned their site, greatly improving its maintainability. Responsive design was important, as many of the site&rsquo;s users browse on their iPads.</p>
      <h3>Quality Control</h3>
      <p>I developed a style guide for website copy and product naming guidelines. I also established a social media policy and hired a social media manager, an effort which saw a marked improvement in user engagement. I continue to oversee copywriting and illustrative work.</p>
      <h3>Developer Workflow</h3>
      <p>I implemented git for version control, set up development and production environments, and enforced best practises for a team of developers from different companies. I also helped set up the server that runs their production website, optimizing it for security and speed.</p>
      <h3>Newsletters</h3>
      <p>Using a series of custom-developed, responsive MailChimp templates, I send a variety of weekly newsletters to a growing list of subscribers&mdash;currently over 31,000.</p>
      <h3>Branding &amp; Promotions</h3>
      <p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve helped grow the Wicker Emporium brand as they introduced it to new markets. I spearheaded shifting the brand focus&mdash;gradually&mdash;to a more modern look-and-feel.</p>
      <p>This has meant the introduction of new fonts, patterns, and stylistic elements into an overall style library that is used for advertisements, posters, print and web ads, signage, tags, gift cards, invitations, and all manner of materials.</p>
